### what is blog for

This is a place for logging thing new to me. Not like another people I don't want to use github page as a portfolio or something.  

### Things you can see on here

Which means the theme of the articles are not fixed. Recently, I have big interest in philosophy and religion. so I'll write about that(if I can write that in english). at the same time I like to upload some notes about DL/ML or CS.

### Can it be wiki?

From the day, when I read a book about porsonal encyclopedia. I like to make one. But till few months ago. I thought I am good at loading something from memory well. Eventhough I am not on memorizing(saving). Somehow, the idea of making my own wiki came out. As I wrote before, I am now studying philosophy. If I learning some concept of that and read other concept in other material. I need to modify or add some information of previous concept. And need to reconnect between concepts to understand completely. That was the story that make me to think of create a personal wikiwiki. I want to use this blog like a wiki site.
